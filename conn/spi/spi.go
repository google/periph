// Package spi defines the API to communicate with devices over the SPI
// protocol.
//
// As described in https://periph.io/x/periph/conn#hdr-Concepts, periph.io uses
// the concepts of Bus, Port and Conn.
//
// In the package spi, 'Bus' is not exposed, as it would be SPI bus number
// without a CS line, for example on linux asking for "/dev/spi0" without the
// ".0" suffix.
//
// The OS doesn't allow that so it is counter productive to express this at the
// API layer, so 'Port' is exposed directly instead.
//
// Use Port.Connect() converts the uninitialized Port into a Conn.
//
// See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface for more
// information.
