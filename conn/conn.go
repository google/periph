// Conn defines the interface for a connection on a point-to-point
// communication channel.
//
// The channel may either be write-only or read-write, either half-duplex or
// full duplex.
//
// This is the lowest common denominator for all point-to-point communication
// channels.

	// Tx does a single transaction.
	//
	// For full duplex protocols (SPI, UART), the two buffers must have the same
	// length as both reading and writing happen simultaneously.
	//
	// For half duplex protocols (IÂ²C), there is no restriction as reading
	// happens after writing, and r can be nil.
