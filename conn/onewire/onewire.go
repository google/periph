// Package onewire defines the API to communicate with devices over the Dallas
// Semiconductor / Maxim Integrated 1-wire protocol.
//
// As described in https://periph.io/x/periph/conn#hdr-Concepts, periph.io uses
// the concepts of Bus, Port and Conn.
//
// In the package onewire, 'Port' is not exposed, since once you know the 1-wire
// device address, there's no unconfigured Port to configure.
//
// Instead, the package includes the adapter 'Dev' to directly convert an 1-wire
// bus 'onewire.Bus' into a connection 'conn.Conn' by only specifying the device
// 1-wire address.
//
// See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-Wire for more information.
