# gpio-test

Verifies that the library physically work. It requires the user to connect two
GPIO pins together and provide their pin number at the command line.

Sample output running on a Raspberry Pi:

```
$ gpio-test 12 6
Using drivers:
  - bcm283x
  - rpi
  - sysfs-gpio
  - sysfs-spi
  - sysfs-i2c
Using pins and their current state:
- GPIO12: In/High
- GPIO6: In/High
