# BUILD

# The build target cross compiles each program in cmd to a binary for each platform in the bin
# directory. It is assumed that each command has a main.go file in its directory. Trying to keep all
# this relatively simple and not descend into makefile hell...

# Get a list of all main.go in cmd subdirs
# MAINS becomes: cmd/gpio-list/main.go cmd/periph-info/main.go ...
MAINS := $(wildcard cmd/*/main.go)
# Get a list of all the commands, i.e. names of dirs that contain a main.go
# CMDS becomes: gpio-list periph-info ...
CMDS  := $(patsubst cmd/%/main.go,%,$(MAINS))
# Get a list of binaries to build
# BINS becomes: bin/gpio-list-arm bin/periph-info-arm ... bin/gpio-list-arm64 bin/periph-info-arm64 ...
