// PWENi is used to enable/disable the corresponding channel. Setting this bit
// to 1 enables the channel and transmitter state machine. All registers and
// FIFO is writable without setting this bit.
//
// MODEi bit is used to determine mode of operation. Setting this bit to 0
// enables PWM mode. In this mode data stored in either PWM_DATi or FIFO is
// transmitted by pulse width modulation within the range defined by PWM_RNGi.
// When this mode is used MSENi defines whether to use PWM algorithm. Setting
// MODEi to 1 enables serial mode, in which data stored in either PWM_DATi or
// FIFO is transmitted serially within the range defined by PWM_RNGi. Data is
// transmitted MSB first and truncated or zeropadded depending on PWM_RNGi.
// Default mode is PWM.
//
// RPTLi is used to enable/disable repeating of the last data available in the
// FIFO just before it empties. When this bit is 1 and FIFO is used, the last
// available data in the FIFO is repeatedly sent. This may be useful in PWM
// mode to avoid duty cycle gaps. If the FIFO is not used this bit does not
// have any effect. Default operation is do-notrepeat.
//
// SBITi defines the state of the output when no transmission takes place. It
// also defines the zero polarity for the zero padding in serialiser mode. This
// bit is padded between two consecutive transfers as well as tail of the data
// when PWM_RNGi is larger than bit depth of data being transferred. this bit
// is zero by default.
//
// POLAi is used to configure the polarity of the output bit. When set to high
// the final output is inverted. Default operation is no inversion.
//
// USEFi bit is used to enable/disable FIFO transfer. When this bit is high
// data stored in the FIFO is used for transmission. When it is low, data
// written to PWM_DATi is transferred. This bit is 0 as default.
//
// CLRF is used to clear the FIFO. Writing a 1 to this bit clears the FIFO.
// Writing 0 has no effect. This is a single shot operation and reading the bit
// always returns 0.
//
// MSENi is used to determine whether to use PWM algorithm or simple M/S ratio
// transmission. When this bit is high M/S transmission is used. This bit is
// zero as default. When MODEi is 1, this configuration bit has no effect.
//
// See page 139-140 for the description of the PWM and M/S ratio algorithms.
