// makeEvent creates an epoll *edge* triggered event.
//
// An edge triggered event is basically an "auto-reset" event, where waiting on
// the edge resets it. A level triggered event requires manual resetting; this
// could be done via a Read() call but there's no need to require the user to
// call Read(). This is particularly useless in the case of gpio.Rising and
// gpio.Falling.
//
// As per the official doc, edge triggers is still remembered even when no
// epoll_wait() call is running, so no edge is missed. Two edges will be
// coallesced into one if the user mode process can't keep up. There's no
// accumulation of edges.
