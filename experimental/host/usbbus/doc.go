// Package usbbus implements OS specific functions for conn/usb.
//
// This includes handling the connected devices on process startup and handling
// of the connection events.
//
// This package is only built with the build tag 'usb' because it causes a
// dependency on https://github.com/kylelemons/gousb. This package uses cgo that
// depends on libusb being installed. This is generally not the case by
// default, so it causes a go get failure which is really obnoxious to users.
//
// Ubuntu
//
//     sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev
