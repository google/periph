// Package apa102 drives a strip of APA102 LEDs connected on a SPI bus.
//
// These devices are interesting because they have 2 PWMs: one global of 5 bits
// of resolution and one per channel of 8 bits of resolution. This means that
// the dynamic range is of 13 bits.
//
// This driver handles color intensity and temperature correction and uses the
// full near 8000:1 dynamic range as supported by the device.
