# periph - Peripherals I/O in Go


## Features

* Continuously tested on [Raspberry Pi](https://raspberrypi.org),
  [C.H.I.P.](https://getchip.com/) and Windows 10 via
  [gohci](https://github.com/periph/gohci).
* Interfaces: IÂ²C, SPI, gpio (both low latency memory mapped registers and
  zero-CPU edge detection), 1-wire and more.
* Devices: apa102, bme280, ds18b20, ssd1306, tm1637, and more coming.


## Quick links

* [doc/users/](doc/users/) for ready-to-use tools.
* [doc/apps/](doc/apps/) to use `periph` as a library. The complete API
  documentation, including examples, is at
  [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/periph.io/x/periph?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/periph.io/x/periph).
* [doc/drivers/](doc/drivers/) to expand the list of supported hardware.


## Users

periph includes [many ready-to-use tools](cmd/)! See [doc/users/](doc/users/)
for more info on configuring the host and using the included tools.

```bash
# Retrieve and install all the commands at once:
go get periph.io/x/periph/cmd/...
# List the host drivers registered and/or initialized:
periph-info
# List the known headers:
headers-list
# List the known GPIO state:
gpio-list
```


## Application developers

For [application developers](doc/apps/), `periph` provides OS-independent bus
interfacing. It really tries hard to _get out of the way_. Here's the canonical
"toggle a LED" sample:


```go
package main

import (
    "time"
    "periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio"
    "periph.io/x/periph/host"
)

func main() {
    host.Init()
    for l := gpio.Low; ; l = !l {
        gpio.ByNumber(13).Out(l)
        time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)
    }
}
```

The following are synonyms, use the form you prefer:

* Runtime discovery:
  * [`gpio.ByNumber(13)`](https://godoc.org/periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio/#ByNumber) or [`gpio.ByName("13")`](https://godoc.org/periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio/#ByName)
  *  [`gpio.ByName("GPIO13")`](https://godoc.org/periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio/#ByName)
* Using global variables:
  * [`rpi.P1_33`](https://godoc.org/periph.io/x/periph/host/rpi#/P1_33) to select the pin via its position on the board
  * [`bcm283x.GPIO13`](https://godoc.org/periph.io/x/periph/host/bcm283x/#GPIO13)

This example uses basically no CPU: the `Out()` call doesn't call into the
kernel. Instead it directly changes the GPIO memory mapped register.


### Samples

See [doc/apps/SAMPLES.md](doc/apps/SAMPLES.md) for more examples.


## Contributions

`periph` provides an extensible driver registry and common bus interfaces which
are explained in more details at [doc/drivers/](doc/drivers/). `periph` is
designed to work well with drivers living in external repositories so you are
not _required_ to fork the periph repository to load out-of-tree drivers for
your platform.

**Every commit is [tested on real hardware](doc/drivers/CONTRIBUTING.md#testing)

driver developers via GitHub pull requests, as long as the author has signed the

## Philosophy

1. Optimize for simplicity, correctness and usability in that order.
   * e.g. everything, interfaces and structs, uses strict typing, there's no
     `interface{}` in sight.
2. OS agnostic. Clear separation of interfaces in [conn/](conn/),
   enablers in [host/](host) and device drivers in [devices/](devices/).
   * e.g. no devfs or sysfs path in sight.
   * e.g. conditional compilation enables only the relevant drivers to be loaded
     on each platform.
3. ... yet doesn't get in the way of platform specific code.
   * e.g. A user can use statically typed global variables
     [rpi.P1_3](https://godoc.org/periph.io/x/periph/host/rpi#pkg-variables),
     [bcm283x.GPIO2](https://godoc.org/periph.io/x/periph/host/bcm283x#Pin)
     to refer to the exact same pin on a Raspberry Pi.
3. The user can chose to optimize for performance instead of usability.
   * e.g.
     [apa102.Dev](https://godoc.org/periph.io/x/periph/devices/apa102#Dev)
     exposes both high level
     [draw.Image](https://golang.org/pkg/image/draw/#Image) to draw an image and
     low level [io.Writer](https://golang.org/pkg/io/#Writer) to write raw RGB
     24 bits pixels. The user chooses.
4. Use a divide and conquer approach. Each component has exactly one
   responsibility.
   * e.g. instead of having a driver per "platform", there's a driver per
     "component": one for the CPU, one for the board headers, one for each
     bus and sensor, etc.
5. Extensible via a [driver
   registry](https://godoc.org/periph.io/x/periph#Register).
   * e.g. a user can inject a custom driver to expose more pins, headers, etc.
     A USB device (like an FT232H) can expose headers _in addition_ to the
     headers found on the host.
6. The drivers must use the fastest possible implementation.
   * e.g. both
     [allwinner](https://godoc.org/periph.io/x/periph/host/allwinner)
     and
     [bcm283x](https://godoc.org/periph.io/x/periph/host/bcm283x)
     leverage sysfs gpio to expose interrupt driven edge detection, yet use
     memory mapped GPIO registers to perform single-cycle reads and writes.
